This repository contains scripts and files for the paper: "Machine Learning Potential Powered Insights into the Mechanical Stability of Amorphous Li-Si Alloys"

This repository contains the LAMMPS files required to run MD simulations of stretching Li_13Si_4 bulk structure. The input files are available above: "Li_13-Si_4-bulk-stretch.in" (input file), "Li.pytorch.nn", and "Si.pytorch.nn" (force field files).

The provided Jupyter Notebook file ( "Analysis.ipynb" ) can be used to generate visualization plot of training machine learning potential, and stress-strain plot of stretching bulk structure.
